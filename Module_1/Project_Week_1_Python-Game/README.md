## Project Description
On this project we work in groups and create our first software in Python!
We choose the Masterming game 



## Mastermind
Mastermind  is a code-breaking game.It resembles an earlier pencil and paper game called Bulls and Cows that may date back a century.

## Project Goals
During this project we succeed to :
* Fork and manage our own git repository. 
* Plan our project.
* Build our own code from scratch. 
* Put into practice the basic Python concepts learned during the week.
* Get used to public presentations. 

## How to use it ?
The computer choose a combination of 4 elements with colors from the list: Black, Green, Blue, White, Yellow, Red and Pink
The user is asked to gess the combination in less or 12 tries.
He is asked to input his proposition using single letters: 
‘k' for Black ; ‘g’ for Green ; ‘b' for Blue ; ‘w’ for White ; ‘y’ for Yellow ; 'r’ for Red ; 'p’ for Pink
The computer will respond with the number of well placed elements, and the numbers of missplaced element with the right color.
The user will have only 12 tries to gess the combinaison

## Good luck!
