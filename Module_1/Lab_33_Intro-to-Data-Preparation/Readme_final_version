Data analysis:

Minus:
- There are two columns that are duplicates (TransactionID)
- There are missing values in the BirthYear column
- There are missing values in the Profession column
- The professions are heterogeneous (e.g. HR / hr)
- Some professions need to be translated (e.g. etudient into student)
- The BirthYear and Department are interpreted as float whereas they should be interpreted as integers
- It seems to be an outlier in the Amount column for the developer Profession

Plus:
- No additionnal spaces are added in the columns' names

Plan for data preparation:
1. Remove the duplicate column and the empty column
2. Check if the TransactionID and ClientID are uniques
3. Handle the null values
4. Convert the BirtYear, Department, TransactionID and ClientID into integers
5. Replace professions values so that they are homogeneous
